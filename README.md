### Leveraging the efficiency of the Customer retention process in the Banking sector using Churn Analytics 
### Business Problem:
###### Following the debacle of the 2008 subprime financial crisis, the Reserve Bank of India(RBI) resorted to extreme accommodating monetary measures such as quantitative easing and zero interest rate policies in order to catalyze growth. Banks, whose principal source of income largely depends on the interest rate set by the RBI were hurt. This scenario has been ongoing for a number of years now, with no near term expected shift of policy from the RBI in sight. In an effort to counter these measures, banks were left with no choice but to find alternative sources of income, which in essence have consisted in containing costs and reviewing their pricing policies by charging higher commissions. Such measures, while successful in leveraging the complementary margins of banks (income gained through commissions), have had nonetheless a negative impact on customer satisfaction, and consequently have led to increased levels of customer churn.

 ### Objective of the project:
 ###### 1)Analyse an organization specific customer data to zero-in on the most statistically significant factors that are impacting the customer churn at the organization.
 ###### 2)Develop a classification model with the results obtained in stage one. The model will detect customer churn for individual customers. If customer churn detected, it will     predict the customer lifetime value for the customer in consideration.
 ###### 3)Deploy the model in the form of a web application to the cloud.
 
 ### Outcomes expected:
 ###### The application will enable the decision makers at an organization to plan out their marketing strategy focused on customer retention, eventually saving them a major chunk of time, resources and energy.
